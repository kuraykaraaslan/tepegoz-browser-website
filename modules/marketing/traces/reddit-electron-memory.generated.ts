 *
 * One recorded agent run, exactly as the product's own event stream reported it.
 *
 * Nothing here is editorial. `message` and `detail` are the strings the agent
 * runtime emitted; they are not copy, they never pass through the locale
 * rewriter, and no step was removed because it was unflattering. The run failed
 * a step at least once in every capture kept so far, and that step is in here.
 *
 * English only, and not because Turkish is an afterthought: these are product
 * strings emitted in English by the runtime. A translated trace would be a
 * translation of evidence, which is no longer evidence. The copy AROUND the
 * replay translates; the record does not.
 *
 * Verified two ways: `sources-check.mjs` compares the stamp above against the
 * product repo when a checkout is present, and `trace-check.mjs` re-validates
 * the shape below with no checkout at all, which is the only one Vercel can run.
