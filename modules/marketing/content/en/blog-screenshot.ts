            "The consequence nobody writes on the ADR: those views are composited by the compositor, **outside the host window's own `webContents`**. So Playwright's `page.screenshot()` sees the renderer, the renderer draws the chrome, and the page is not in the renderer. Electron's `BrowserWindow.capturePage()` sees the same thing, for the same reason.",
            'Both return a picture of a browser with nothing in it. The isolation that makes tabs safe is the isolation that makes them invisible to the two obvious capture APIs.',
            'Internal `tepegoz://` pages — settings, extensions, downloads — render in the renderer window and capture correctly. That is why the first usable screenshots I shipped were all of internal pages. It was not an editorial choice. It was the only thing that worked.',

            'I had another browser open with a tab named after this project. The capture grabbed **that** window: my open tabs, my bookmarks bar, my profile avatar. Straight into a folder of files destined for a public marketing page.',
            'The fix looked obvious — match by process id instead of title. That is a better identifier, and it was still wrong. `CopyFromScreen` does not copy a window. It copies a rectangle of the screen, and whatever is in front of that rectangle is what lands in the file. The code calls `SetForegroundWindow` first, and Windows is entitled to refuse foreground activation — it frequently does, for exactly the anti-hijacking reasons that make it a good rule. The second capture came back with a video that was playing on my own desktop.',
            "Two captures, two different pieces of somebody's screen that had no business being in a marketing asset. Neither was published. Both were deleted within a minute of being looked at, which is the only part of this story that went right, and it only went right because I looked.",
            '**The lesson is not "match windows more carefully."** It is that _screen_ capture and _window_ capture are different operations, and an API that reads the framebuffer cannot be made into the second one by being more careful about which rectangle you ask for. A tool whose failure mode is "silently captures whatever the human was doing" does not belong in an automated pipeline, at any level of care.',

Match one against the other, feed the result to `setDisplayMediaRequestHandler`, and `getDisplayMedia` in the renderer returns a stream of **that window**, composited views included, resolved by an identifier Electron issued about itself.
